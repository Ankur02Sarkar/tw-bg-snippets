# Second Brain: tw-bg-snippets

## üéØ Current Focus
- Successfully implemented color modifier component for real-time background color customization
- Added search, pagination, and background name display features

## ‚úÖ Project Checklist
- [x] Setup Next.js project with `bun`
- [x] Initialize `shadcn/ui` with light/dark theme support
- [x] Implement search functionality for backgrounds
- [x] Add pagination with configurable items per page
- [x] Display background names on playground cards
- [x] Create responsive grid layout for background display
- [x] Implement color modifier component with color pickers
- [x] Add real-time color extraction and modification
- [x] Create floating color modifier panel with toggle visibility

## üìù To-Do List (Next Actions)
- [ ] Test color modifier functionality with different background types
- [ ] Verify color extraction works for various color formats (hex, rgba, hsl)
- [ ] Ensure color modifications persist during preview
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Add more sophisticated color detection algorithms if needed

## üêû Known Issues / Refactors
- [ ] Color extraction might miss some complex CSS color patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization needed for real-time color modifications

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Decisions
- All data fetching will be done in RSCs and passed down as props
- Using `cuid()` for primary keys in the Prisma schema (if database is added later)
- All components will be sourced from `shadcn/ui` where possible to maintain design consistency
- Search and pagination implemented with client-side filtering for performance
- Background names displayed using absolute positioning within playground cards
- Color modifier uses regex-based color extraction and real-time DOM manipulation
- Floating UI pattern for color modifier to avoid layout interference

## üé® New Features Implemented
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search backgrounds by name with real-time filtering
- **Pagination**: Configurable items per page (5, 10, 15, 20) with page navigation
- **Background Name Display**: Each playground card now shows the background name in the bottom-left corner
- **Color Modifier Component**: 
  - Automatically extracts colors from the currently previewed background
  - Provides color pickers for each detected color
  - Real-time preview updates as colors are modified
  - Toggle visibility with floating panel design
  - Reset functionality to restore original colors
  - Support for hex, rgba, and other CSS color formats
- **Responsive Design**: Search, pagination, and color modifier adapt to different screen sizes
- **Results Information**: Shows current results count and search query feedback
